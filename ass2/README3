This is README file for tagger3 and tagger3_no_emb:
The tagger is assuming the ner and pos directories and the vocab and word vectors files are in the same directory of the code
each epoch it will print the accuracy on the dev set
we decided to make two files this time one for the tagger with the pre-trained embedding and one for the tagger without embedding

the default parameters for tagger3 with the pre-trained embeddings are:
mid_dim = int((DIM * 5 + out_dim) / 2)
alpha = 0.5 (divided by 2 every 5 epochs)
epochs = 5
batch_size = 256
rounds_per_epoch = 4096

the default parameters for tagger3 without the pre-trained embeddings are:
mid_dim = int((DIM * 5 + out_dim) / 2)
alpha = 0.1 (divided by 2 every 7 epochs)
epochs = 15
batch_size = 256
rounds_per_epoch = 4096

we recommend you to run the tagger3 without the pre-trained embedding.
the preparation time of the tagger3.py is very long.
even though, the best results are from the tagger3.py model (witch is with the pre-trained embedding)

the running command is:(you can change the parameters inside the file)
python3 tagger3.py <trainer_state(pos/ner)>
or if you want to run the pre trained embedded code
python3 tagger3_no_emb.py <trainer_state(pos/ner)>

for example:
"python3 tagger3.py pos" will run the tagger on the pos data
